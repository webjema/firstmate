# Watcher liveness and worktree-tangle guard, called at the top of the
# supervision scripts.
# First, always warn if the firstmate primary checkout (FM_ROOT) is on a named
# non-default branch, because that means firstmate-on-itself work landed in the
# primary instead of an isolated worktree.
# Then, if any task is in flight (a state/<id>.meta exists) and the watcher's
# liveness beacon (state/.last-watcher-beat, touched every poll cycle) is
# missing or older than FM_GUARD_GRACE seconds, prints a loud, clearly delimited
# banner so the agent cannot skim past it in the tool output of whatever it was
# doing - the one channel every harness has. Normal wake handling (watcher
# briefly down between a wake and its re-arm) stays inside the grace window and
# stays silent. Always exits 0: the guard warns, it never blocks.
