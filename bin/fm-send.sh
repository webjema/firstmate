#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Send one line of literal text to a crewmate endpoint, then Enter.
# Usage: fm-send.sh <target> <text...>
#   <target> may be a bare firstmate task name (fm-xyz), resolved through
#   this home's state/<id>.meta, or an explicit backend target.
# Special keys instead of text: fm-send.sh <target> --key Enter
# Key support is backend-specific: tmux/herdr support Escape, Enter, and C-c;
# Orca currently supports Enter and C-c only, and rejects Escape.
#
# Text submission is verified: the line is typed ONCE, then Enter is sent and
# retried (Enter only, never retyped) until the target backend reports a
# submitted/cleared composer or an inconclusive send. If a swallowed Enter is
# positively confirmed (the text is still sitting in the composer after all
# retries), fm-send exits NON-ZERO so the caller knows the steer did not land
# instead of silently leaving an unsubmitted instruction.
# Submission dispatches through the target's recorded backend; the tmux adapter
# shares its composer/submit core with the away-mode daemon via bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh.
# Tune with FM_SEND_RETRIES (default 3) / FM_SEND_SLEEP (0.4).
# Slash commands, and codex `$...` skill invocations resolved through harness
# meta, get a longer pre-Enter settle so completion popups do not swallow Enter.
#
# From-firstmate marker: when the resolved target is a bare `fm-<id>` whose meta
# records kind=secondmate, the text is prefixed with the from-firstmate marker
# (bin/fm-marker-lib.sh) so the secondmate routes its reply via its status file
# or a status-pointed doc instead of stranding it in chat the main firstmate
# never reads. A crewmate/scout target, an explicit backend-target escape-hatch
# target, and the --key path are never marked - their behavior is unchanged.
# After a successful text submit fm-send pauses FM_SEND_SETTLE seconds (default 1,
# 0 disables) before returning: a cleared composer only proves the text was
# submitted, but the harness needs a beat to spin up the turn before its busy
# footer appears, so an immediate peek would otherwise see the stale idle pane.
# The pause is fm-send-only; the shared submit core (used by the away-mode daemon,
# which only needs "submitted") does not pay it, and the --key path is unaffected.
