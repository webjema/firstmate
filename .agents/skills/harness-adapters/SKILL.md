# harness-adapters

Use this reference before any harness-specific firstmate operation: spawn, recovery, trust-dialog handling, skill invocation, interrupt, exit, resume, or adapter verification.

Crewmates default to the same harness firstmate is running on unless `config/crew-harness` records an adapter name.
The captain may override that file at bootstrap or later; a per-task instruction such as "run this one on codex" overrides it for that dispatch only.
`default` means mirror firstmate's own harness.

Each adapter splits into mechanics and knowledge.
The mechanics, including launch command, autonomy flag, and turn-end hook, live in `bin/fm-spawn.sh`.
The supervision knowledge lives here: busy signature, exit command, interrupt, dialogs, resume behavior, skill invocation, and quirks.

Never dispatch a crewmate or secondmate on an unverified adapter.
If `config/crew-harness` names an unverified adapter, tell the captain and fall back to firstmate's own harness until that adapter is verified.
If the captain asks for a new harness, propose verifying it first: spawn a trivial supervised task using `fm-spawn`'s raw-launch-command escape hatch, confirm every fact empirically, then record the mechanics in `fm-spawn`, the busy signature in `fm-watch.sh` and `fm-tmux-lib.sh` defaults, any needed `FM_COMPOSER_IDLE_RE` empty-composer override, and the verified knowledge here.

## Detection

`bin/fm-harness.sh` prints firstmate's own harness, using verified env markers first and then process ancestry.
`bin/fm-harness.sh crew` resolves the effective crewmate harness from `config/crew-harness`.
On `unknown`, ask the captain instead of guessing.
A captain override always beats detection.
When verifying a new adapter, record its env marker and command name in `bin/fm-harness.sh`.

For stuck recovery, the target window's harness is recorded as `harness=` in `state/<id>.meta`.
Use that value for interrupt, exit, resume, and skill-invocation facts.

## no-mistakes skill invocation

Send the validation skill using the target harness's skill invocation form.
Natural language is acceptable if uncertain.

- claude: `/<skill>`, for example `/no-mistakes`.
- codex: `$<skill>`, for example `$no-mistakes`; `/<skill>` is claude-only and codex rejects it as "Unrecognized command".
- opencode: no separate verified skill invocation beyond normal slash-command behavior; use natural language if the exact skill command is uncertain.
- pi: no separate verified skill invocation beyond normal command behavior; use natural language if the exact skill command is uncertain.
- grok: `/<skill>`, for example `/no-mistakes` (same form as claude). Verified end to end: grok discovers the user-level `no-mistakes` skill, `/no-mistakes` invokes it, and grok drives a real `no-mistakes axi run`. Like codex's `$`/`/` popups, typing `/<skill>` opens grok's slash-autocomplete, so a too-fast Enter selects the popup entry instead of sending; `fm_tmux_submit_core`'s retried Enter (used by `fm-send`) lands it.

## claude (VERIFIED)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy-pane signature | `esc to interrupt` |
| Exit command | `/exit` |
| Interrupt | single Escape |
| Skill invocation | `/<skill>` (e.g. `/no-mistakes`) |

First launch in a fresh worktree, or first ever on a machine, may show a trust or bypass-permissions confirmation.
After every spawn, peek the pane within about 20 seconds.
If such a dialog is showing, accept it with `bin/fm-send.sh <window> --key Enter`, or the choice the dialog requires, and verify the brief started processing.

Claude renders a predicted-next-prompt suggestion as dim/faint text inside an otherwise-empty composer after a turn completes.
A plain `tmux capture-pane` cannot tell that ghost text apart from typed text.
Firstmate launches every claude crewmate and secondmate with `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=false`, scoped to firstmate-launched agents through `bin/fm-spawn.sh`, so it never touches the captain's global config.
The CLI's `--prompt-suggestions` flag is print/SDK-mode only and does not suppress the interactive composer ghost text, verified empirically on v2.1.186.
As defense in depth for any pane that flag cannot reach, including the captain's own firstmate composer that away-mode reads, the pane reader in `bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh` captures only the composer line with ANSI styling, drops dim/faint SGR 2 runs, and ignores them, so only normal-intensity typed text counts as pending input.
That styled capture is internal to the boolean detector only.
`fm-peek` and every other human or LLM-facing capture path stays plain `tmux capture-pane` with no escape codes.

## codex (VERIFIED 2026-06-11, codex-cli 0.139.0)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy-pane signature | `esc to interrupt` (shown as `• Working (Xs • esc to interrupt)`) |
| Exit command | `/quit` (slash popup needs about 1 second between text and Enter; `fm-send` handles it) |
| Interrupt | single Escape |
| Skill invocation | `$<skill>` (e.g. `$no-mistakes`); `/<skill>` is claude-only and codex rejects it as "Unrecognized command" |

A `$<skill>` invocation opens a `$`-autocomplete (skill) popup, the same hazard as the `/` slash popup: submitting too fast lets the popup swallow the Enter, so the invocation never lands.
`fm-send` handles it the same way it handles `/` - it gives the popup a longer settle (1.2s) between typing and the first Enter, with `fm_tmux_submit_core`'s retried Enter as the safety net - but the `$` settle is scoped to `harness=codex`, read from the target's `state/<id>.meta`.
That scope matters because, unlike `/`, a leading `$` commonly starts ordinary text (`$5/month`, `$HOME`), so a universal `$` rule would needlessly slow plain steers to claude/opencode/pi; only a codex target receiving a `$...` message gets the popup-settle.
An explicit `session:window` target has no meta, so its harness is unknown and treated as non-codex (the safe fast-path default).
This is why the validation trigger (`$no-mistakes`) to a codex crew now lands on the first Enter instead of biting the popup.

Directory trust dialog on first run per repo root: "Do you trust the contents of this directory?"
Accept with Enter.
The decision persists for the repo, so later worktrees of the same project skip it.

Resume after exit with `codex resume <session-id>`.
The session id is printed on quit.

## opencode (VERIFIED 2026-06-11, v1.15.7-1.17.3)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy-pane signature | `esc interrupt` (dotted spinner footer; note no "to") |
| Exit command | `/exit` |
| Interrupt | double Escape; known flaky while a long shell command runs, so a wedged pane may need `/exit` and relaunch |

No trust dialog.
Opencode can auto-upgrade itself in the background and the running TUI can exit mid-task, observed live from 1.15.7 to 1.17.3.
If a pane shows the exit banner, relaunch with `--continue` to resume the session.
`--prompt` does not auto-submit alongside `--continue`, so send the next instruction via `fm-send` once the TUI is up.

## pi (VERIFIED 2026-06-11)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy-pane signature | `Working...` (braille spinner prefix; no `esc to interrupt` text) |
| Exit command | `/quit` |
| Interrupt | single Escape |

Pi has no permission system, so crewmates are always autonomous.
Keep the brief as one positional argument.
Multiple positional args become separate queued messages; `fm-spawn`'s template already does this correctly.

Project trust dialog can appear on the first pi run in any not-yet-trusted directory, observed even on clean worktrees.
Accept with Enter.
The decision persists per path in `~/.pi/agent/trust.json`, so later spawns in the same worktree slot skip it.

`fm-spawn` keeps the turn-end extension in `state/`, outside the worktree, because project-local extension files make the trust gate strictly worse and pollute the project.
The extension must listen for pi's `turn_end` event, not `agent_end`, so the watcher wakes after each completed turn instead of only when the whole agent run exits.
Pi sets `PI_CODING_AGENT=true` for its children; this is its harness-detection env marker.

## grok (VERIFIED 2026-06-29, grok 0.2.73)

Grok Build TUI (`grok`), a Claude-Code-compatible CLI from xAI.
Launch with a positional prompt: `grok --always-approve "$(cat <brief>)"`.

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy-pane signature | `Ctrl+c:cancel` (the mid-turn cancel hint in grok's keybind bar, shown iff a turn is running; the spinner line is a braille glyph + `<status>… N.Ns` + `[stop]`, e.g. `⠹ Thinking… 1.1s … [stop]`). Idle keybind bar shows only `Shift+Tab:mode │ Ctrl+.:shortcuts`. The ASCII `Ctrl+c:cancel` is the busy regex (avoids locale fragility of matching braille). |
| Exit command | `Ctrl+Q` double-press within 1000ms (it is a confirmed destructive action). Prints `Resume this session with: grok --resume <session-id>`. `Ctrl+D` is the quit key in VS Code family terminals. NOT `/exit` and NOT `Ctrl+C`. |
| Interrupt | single `Ctrl+C` (cancels the current turn; the footer shows `Ctrl+c:cancel` mid-turn). `Esc` only moves focus to the scrollback, it does NOT interrupt. |
| Skill invocation | `/<skill>` (e.g. `/no-mistakes`), same as claude. Opens a slash-autocomplete popup, so a too-fast Enter selects the popup entry instead of sending - `fm-send`'s retried Enter lands it. |
| Autonomy | `--always-approve` (footer shows `· always-approve`); auto-approves every tool execution, verified to run fully unattended. `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` is the stronger equivalent. |
| Env marker | `GROK_AGENT=1`, set for child/tool processes. grok does NOT set `CLAUDECODE` despite Claude compatibility, so the marker is unambiguous. |
| Resume | `grok --resume <session-id>` (id printed on exit) or `grok -c` / `--continue` (most recent for the cwd); `--fork-session` branches a new session id. |

Startup dialog: the "Run Grok Build in a project directory?" project picker appears ONLY when grok is launched from a non-project directory (home, Desktop, Downloads, `/tmp`).
`fm-spawn` launches inside the treehouse worktree (a git repo root), so the picker never appears and grok treats the worktree as a trusted project automatically - no post-launch keystroke is needed.
Pin `[hints] project_picker_disabled = true` in `~/.grok/config.toml` if a non-project launch ever needs to skip it.

No composer ghost text: grok's idle composer is a bare `❯`, already classified empty by the generic composer reader, so no `FM_COMPOSER_IDLE_RE` override is needed.

Turn-end hook: grok fires a `Stop` hook at every turn boundary, giving firstmate a precise per-turn wake instead of only stale-pane detection.
grok loads PROJECT hooks (`<worktree>/.grok/hooks/`, `<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json`) only after the folder is granted hook-trust in `~/.grok/trusted_folders.toml`, which is not automatic and which firstmate will not establish by editing grok's own managed trust store.
GLOBAL hooks in `~/.grok/hooks/` are always trusted and load on first launch.
So `fm-spawn` installs ONE firstmate-owned global hook, `~/.grok/hooks/fm-turn-end.json`, plus the companion `~/.grok/hooks/fm-turn-end.sh`, guarded as a no-op for every non-firstmate grok session.
Its `Stop` command fires only when the current workspace holds a `.fm-grok-turnend` token pointer that matches the firstmate-owned hook registry under `~/.grok/hooks/fm-turn-end.d/`.
`fm-spawn` writes that per-task pointer (`<worktree>/.fm-grok-turnend`, gitignored via git info/exclude like the other harnesses' worktree hook files) and a matching registry entry naming this task's `state/<id>.turn-ended`.
The hook reads `$GROK_WORKSPACE_ROOT`, which is always set for hooks and equals the worktree.
This keeps the hook outside the worktree, needs no trust grant, and writes only firstmate-owned files.
`fm-teardown` removes the worktree pointer before returning a pooled worktree.
Secondmate spawns skip the pointer (idle panes are healthy, no stale-pane detection for them).
