# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute.
One rule up front:

**Human-authored pull requests targeting `main` must be raised through [`no-mistakes`](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes).**
We require this to reduce the maintainer's burden of reviewing and merging contributions.

`no-mistakes` puts a local git proxy in front of your real remote.
Pushing through it runs an AI-driven review/test/lint pipeline in an isolated worktree, forwards the push upstream only after every check passes, and opens a clean PR automatically.

A GitHub Actions check (`Require no-mistakes`) runs on PRs targeting `main` and fails if the body is missing the deterministic signature that no-mistakes writes.
Dependency bots are exempt so their automation keeps working, but regular contributor PRs without the signature will not be reviewed or merged.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo, then clone the parent repo or set your local `origin` back to the parent (`git@github.com:kunchenguid/firstmate.git`).
2. Create a branch and make your changes.
3. Initialize the gate with your fork as the push target: `no-mistakes init --fork-url git@github.com:<you>/firstmate.git` (fork routing requires **no-mistakes v1.30.1+**; without a fork, plain `no-mistakes init` still works for maintainers with push access).
4. Commit your changes.
5. Push through the gate instead of pushing to `origin`:

   ```sh
   git push no-mistakes
   ```

6. Run `no-mistakes` to attach to the pipeline, watch findings, authorize auto-fixes, and review ask-user findings as needed.
   While a run is active, let the pipeline apply authorized fixes instead of editing or committing them by hand.
7. Once the pipeline passes, it pushes the branch to your fork and opens the PR against the parent repo for you.

## Repo conventions

- This repo is a template for running a firstmate orchestrator agent.
  `AGENTS.md` is the agent's main job description and names when to load bundled skills; `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it, and `.claude/skills` is a symlink to `.agents/skills`.
- Only shared material is tracked: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.tasks.toml`, `.github/workflows/`, `bin/`, and `.agents/skills/`.
  Everything personal to one captain's fleet (`data/`, `state/`, `config/`, `projects/`, `.no-mistakes/`) is gitignored; never commit it.
  The root `.tasks.toml` is tracked `tasks-axi` config for `data/backlog.md`; compatible `tasks-axi` uses it for routine backlog mutations.
  It does not make `data/` tracked.
- Helper scripts in `bin/` are plain bash.
  Each starts with a usage header comment; keep it accurate when you change behavior.
  Test scripts and helpers in `tests/` are plain bash too.
  `shellcheck bin/*.sh tests/*.sh` must pass, and CI enforces it.
- Changes to harness adapters (launch templates in `bin/fm-spawn.sh`, facts in `.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md`) must be verified empirically against the real harness, never written from documentation alone.
- In Markdown, put each full sentence on its own line.

## Development

Tracked changes to firstmate itself - `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.tasks.toml`, `.github/workflows/`, `bin/`, and agent skill files - ship through the `no-mistakes` pipeline on a feature branch and require an explicit merge approval.
When supervising live crewmates, keep firstmate's own long validation or build commands in the background so watcher wakes can still be handled.
A crewmate driving its own `no-mistakes` validation does the opposite: it runs the gate in the foreground and lets each synchronous `no-mistakes axi run` or `no-mistakes axi respond` call return.
The pipeline owns auto-fix changes; the crewmate authorizes them with `no-mistakes axi respond --action fix --findings <ids>` instead of editing or committing while the run is active.
Local `.no-mistakes/` state and test evidence stay out of this repo; `.no-mistakes.yaml` keeps evidence in a temp directory instead.

Check and test the toolbelt before pushing:

```sh

shellcheck bin/*.sh tests/*.sh            # lint the toolbelt and behavior tests; CI enforces this
for test_script in tests/*.test.sh; do "$test_script"; done   # behavior tests, matching CI
