# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute.
One rule up front:

**Human-authored pull requests targeting `main` must be raised through [`no-mistakes`](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes).**
We require this to reduce the maintainer's burden of reviewing and merging contributions.

`no-mistakes` puts a local git proxy in front of your real remote.
Pushing through it runs an AI-driven review/test/lint pipeline in an isolated worktree, forwards the push upstream only after every check passes, and opens a clean PR automatically.

A GitHub Actions check (`Require no-mistakes`) runs on PRs targeting `main` and fails if the body is missing the deterministic signature that no-mistakes writes.
Dependency bots are exempt so their automation keeps working, but regular contributor PRs without the signature will not be reviewed or merged.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo, then clone the parent repo or set your local `origin` back to the parent (`git@github.com:kunchenguid/firstmate.git`).
2. Create a branch and make your changes.
3. Initialize the gate with your fork as the push target: `no-mistakes init --fork-url git@github.com:<you>/firstmate.git` (firstmate expects **no-mistakes v1.31.2+**; without a fork, plain `no-mistakes init` still works for maintainers with push access).
4. Commit your changes.
5. Push through the gate instead of pushing to `origin`:

   ```sh
   git push no-mistakes
   ```

6. Run `no-mistakes` to attach to the pipeline, watch findings, authorize auto-fixes, and review ask-user findings as needed.
   Follow the installed no-mistakes version's SKILL.md and live `axi` help for gate mechanics.
7. Once the pipeline passes, it pushes the branch to your fork and opens the PR against the parent repo for you.

## Repo conventions

- This repo is a template for running a firstmate orchestrator agent.
  `AGENTS.md` is the agent's main job description and names when to load bundled skills; `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it, and `.claude/skills` is a symlink to `.agents/skills`.
- Only shared material is tracked: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.tasks.toml`, `.github/workflows/`, `bin/`, and `.agents/skills/`.
  Everything personal to one captain's fleet (`.env`, `data/`, `state/`, `config/`, `projects/`, `.no-mistakes/`) is gitignored; never commit it.
  The root `.tasks.toml` is tracked `tasks-axi` config for `data/backlog.md`; compatible `tasks-axi` uses it for routine backlog mutations.
  It does not make `data/` tracked.
- Helper scripts in `bin/` are plain bash.
  Each starts with a usage header comment; keep it accurate when you change behavior.
  Test scripts and helpers in `tests/` are plain bash too.
  `shellcheck bin/*.sh tests/*.sh` must pass, and CI enforces it.
- Changes to harness adapters (detection in `bin/fm-harness.sh`, launch and hook mechanics in `bin/fm-spawn.sh`, busy signatures in `bin/fm-watch.sh` and `bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh`, cleanup in `bin/fm-teardown.sh`, and facts in `.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md`) must be verified empirically against the real harness, never written from documentation alone.
- In Markdown, put each full sentence on its own line.

## Development

Tracked changes to firstmate itself - `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.tasks.toml`, `.github/workflows/`, `bin/`, and agent skill files - ship through the `no-mistakes` pipeline on a feature branch and require an explicit merge approval.
When supervising live crewmates, keep firstmate's own long validation or build commands in the background so watcher wakes can still be handled.
Crewmate validation follows the installed no-mistakes version's SKILL.md and live `axi` help instead of duplicating gate mechanics in firstmate docs.
Firstmate's wrapper still matters: `ask-user` findings route to the captain through firstmate, and crewmates avoid `--yes` because it silently resolves captain-owned decisions without escalation.
Local `.no-mistakes/` state and test evidence stay out of this repo; `.no-mistakes.yaml` keeps evidence in a temp directory and pins the gate's test command to the same bash behavior suite as CI.
